# Camera_Publish_OpenDDS.cpp
This C++ code is a program that captures video frames from a video capture device (likely a webcam) and publishes them using the OpenSplice DDS (Data Distribution Service) middleware. 
Here's a breakdown of the code: 
1. The program includes the necessary header files from the OpenSplice DDS library to work with publishers, data writers, and topics.
2. The `main()` function is the entry point of the program.
3. Inside the `main()` function, the program initializes an OpenCV video capture object to capture frames from the default video capture device (camera).
4. If the video capture device fails to open, the program prints an error message and returns with an error code.
5. The program then initializes an OpenSplice DDS domain participant, a publisher, and a topic for the video frames (represented as `cv::Mat` objects).
6. The program creates a data writer associated with the publisher and the video frame topic.
7. The program enters a loop where it continuously captures a frame from the video capture device and writes the frame to the DDS data writer.
8. The published video frames can now be received by any other DDS-enabled application that is subscribed to the "VideoFrame" topic.
9. Finally, the program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

In summary, this program is a simple example of how to use OpenCV for video capture and OpenSplice DDS for publishing the captured frames to a distributed system.

# Camera_Subscriber_OpenDDS.cpp
This C++ code is using the Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware to receive and process video frames. 
Here's a breakdown of what the code is doing: 
1. The code includes the necessary header files for DDS and OpenCV (a computer vision library). 
2. The `main()` function is the entry point of the program. 
3. Inside the `main()`, the code initializes a DDS domain participant, which represents a DDS application. 
4. A DDS subscriber is created, which is responsible for receiving data from the DDS network. 
5. A DDS topic is created for the "VideoFrameTopic", which represents the data type (in this case, `cv::Mat`, which is an OpenCV matrix) and the name of the data stream. 
6. A DDS data reader is created, which is associated with the subscriber and the video frame topic. This data reader is responsible for receiving the video frames from the DDS network. 
7. The code then waits for data to be available from the data reader using the `take()` method, which retrieves the available samples (video frames). 
8. For each valid sample (video frame), the code processes the frame using the `cv::Mat` object. This is where you would add your own video frame processing code. 
9. Finally, the program returns 0, indicating successful execution. 

In summary, this code sets up a DDS-based system to receive and process video frames, using OpenCV for the video frame data type. The actual video frame processing logic is left to be implemented by the user.
