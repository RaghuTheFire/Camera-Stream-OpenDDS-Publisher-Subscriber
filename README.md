# Camera_Publish_OpenDDS.cpp
This C++ code is a program that captures video frames from a video capture device (likely a webcam) and publishes them using the OpenSplice DDS (Data Distribution Service) middleware. 
Here's a breakdown of the code: 
1. The program includes the necessary header files from the OpenSplice DDS library to work with publishers, data writers, and topics.
2. The `main()` function is the entry point of the program.
3. Inside the `main()` function, the program initializes an OpenCV video capture object to capture frames from the default video capture device (camera).
4. If the video capture device fails to open, the program prints an error message and returns with an error code.
5. The program then initializes an OpenSplice DDS domain participant, a publisher, and a topic for the video frames (represented as `cv::Mat` objects).
6. The program creates a data writer associated with the publisher and the video frame topic.
7. The program enters a loop where it continuously captures a frame from the video capture device and writes the frame to the DDS data writer.
8. The published video frames can now be received by any other DDS-enabled application that is subscribed to the "VideoFrame" topic.
9. Finally, the program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

In summary, this program is a simple example of how to use OpenCV for video capture and OpenSplice DDS for publishing the captured frames to a distributed system.
